# yt sleep

Simple script to be used in the *Custom Script* section of the [Enhancer for Youtube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhancer-for-youtube/) browser addon.
The script will pause a youtube video playing after a set timeout (default: 120 minutes).
This also works with autoplay as well as manually loading new videos in between, as long as it is in the same tab.
